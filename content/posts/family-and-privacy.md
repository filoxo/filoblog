Social media is becoming so engrained in everyday life for both young and old, it is becoming "normal" to share many aspects of our lives; share about our work, our families, our feelings. But social media is also becoming a problem in that its all too easy to **over share**. 

As an adult, I have no problem when you "over share" about your own work/feelings/whatever else. You're an adult, you choose and are responsible for what you do. I do however take issue when adults take liberties in sharing your child's lives, photos, and experiences without thinking about how far reaching that content goes.

### As a parent...

As a parent, it is your responsibility to protect your child and their "digital identity" is a part of that. Are you inadvertently sharing their photographs without consent? Are you publicizing stories about your child that they wouldn't want others to know? Can anything you put on social media be something your child might ask you to remove in the future?

### Rights to privacy

This issue is pretty complex and the right solution is tricky to arrive to. Here's my thought process.

I, as an adult, worry about things like  securing my personal devices, worrying about my personal "brand", and protecting my identity and financial information. 

Now as a parent, I've begun thinking of my child's financial, educational, and even **technological** future. It important to understand what "privacy" means when applied to a child. Wikipedia offers a concise definition:

> Privacy is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves, or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively.

Sounds pretty good to me but I also realize that a child is no more able to protect this aspect of their lives than they are to provide food for themselves. Years of someone else's Facebook posts and Instagram pics can create an "online profile" of this young individual *without their knowledge or consent*. That's pretty scary.

The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution states

> The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects...

which the US Supreme Court has ruled that this also also encompasses 'digital documents' such as social media profiles and websites.
